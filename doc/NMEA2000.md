## Support of NMEA2000

The objective here, is not describe the NMEA2000 standard, but rather to explain how the standard is taken into account in the system and how to use the associated features.

### Foreword

The NMEA standard is supported and managed by the [NMEA](https://www.nmea.org/). It is a licensed standard that requires any commercial usage to be licensed by the NMEA.
The work herein is based only on open source base completed by reverse engineering. Meaning that it is not based on any official documentation from the NMEA organisation.
Interoperability with other NMEA2000 system is not guaranteed and the operation is under the full responsibility of the final user of the software.

The development of the NMEA2000 protocol and PDU encoding and decoding modules of the *nmea_message_server* is mostly base on two sources:
 - [Timo Lappalainen work on NMEA2000](https://github.com/ttlappalainen)
 - [Canboat from Kees Verruijt](https://github.com/canboat/canboat)

The software does not reuse directly any library from both sources, even not a single line of code, but the documentation associated with their code.
The only direct reuse is the XML NMEA2000 description file that was initially published by Keversoft that has been then moved into **canboat**. That XML file structure has been largely modified from the original version.

One of the obvious difference is that all is developed in Python (3.7) while the base project are in C++ or Javascript.

### NMEA2000 Workflow

The reference file for all NMEA2000 PGN (Parameter Group Number) PDU (Protocol Data Unit) is an XML file that is by default *PGNDefns.N2kDfn.xml*. From that file the whole NMEA processing both realtime and during the development process is derived.
Any error in that file will result in processing errors, so it should be modified with caution.

The XML is interpreted each time upon process start, so any change in file is requested a process restart to be taken into account. The file structure is described in more details in the next paragraph.
The running process is using the memory view created from that file (NMEA2000 metamodel) to interpret incoming PDU and create outgoing PDU.

To improve the processing speed and also offer more processing and communication capabilities, the framework offers also to possibility to automatically generate Protobuf code for communication and Python classes for processing for each PGN.
All code generation is based on the XML definition file.

The **code_generator** generate both Protobuf and Python files for service PGN ('ISO' PGN) that are needed to manage the bus itself and data PGN.

### NMEA2000 XML definition file

The file includes 3 main sections:
 - Global enumerations definitions. To avoid repeating enums in many PGN, those who are used in several PGN PDU definitions are moved to this section.
 - Data format and units definition. This is giving the reference for data visualization
 - PGN definitions by itself

**Note: only the service (ISO) PGN and the one flagged as 'Generate' are considered as fully tested. The others shall be used with caution and require validation testing**

*Note on attributes: If the 'key' attribute is not present, no instance variable and Protobuf fields will NOT be generated for it, meaning that only default values can be used, fields marked as 'Reserved' must have any 'key' defined for it*

**validation**: It is possible to insert a validation function that will detect that the message of the PGN is invalid and therefore shall not be further processed.
The *N2KInvalidMessageException* is raised when the message is detected invalid

### Units for physical quantities

All numerical values are carried as integer on the bus to avoid the complexity of a neutral floating point format. To simplify further processing, the integer values are converted in floating point to represent physical values.
It shall be stated that all physical values on the NMEA2000 bus are carried using International System of Units (SI or ISO80000-1:2009) with a multiplier to fit in an integer value, with some exceptions (see below).
As a reference here are the units in which the physical values are expressed after decoding the PDU.

| Physical value | Unit              | Unit keyword | Comment                                                      |

#### PGN Fields types definition

Fields can be defined with a pre-defined set of types

| Type name            | Possible length in bits | Type definition  | Comment                                                                        |
|----------------------|-------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| UIntField            | 1 to 64                 | Unsigned integer | Fields that are multiple of 8bits are treated as integer, otherwise bit fields |
| InstanceField        | 8-16                    | Unsigned integer |                                                                                |
| IntField             | 8-16-24-32-64           | Signed integer   |                                                                                |
| UDblField            | 16-24-32-64             | Unsigned float   |                                                                                |
| DblField             | 16-24-32-64             | Signed float     |                                                                                |
| EnumField            | 2 to 16                 | Unsigned integer | Possible Enum values are also stored in the meta model and Python classes      |
| FixLengthStringField | multiple of 8           | string           | Unused bytes are padded with 0xFF                                              |
| VarLengthStringField | N/A                     | string           | Variable length (max 253 bytes)                                                |
| NameField            | 64                      | bit field        | Corresponds to the 64 bits of the ISO11783/SAE-J1939 'Name'                    |
| BytesField           | multiple of 8           | bytes            | Fixed length bytes array                                                       |

When the PDU Frame from a PGN includes a set of fields that can be repeated, the  corresponding fields definitions is enclosed inside a **RepeatedFieldSet** element.
That element shall have a 'Count' attribute referencing the Name of the field that holds the number of repetition of the set (that can be 0)

EnumField can have a 'Definition' attribute to reference the global Enum definition in the corresponding section instead of defining all value pairs in the field definition.

### NMEA2000 processing structure

![CAN Handling architectures](https://github.com/Sterwen-Technology/navigation_server/blob/main/doc/Nmea_message_server_CAN-1.png)

#### NMEA2000 processing concepts

The NMEA2000 standard derives from the SAE J1939 standard to whom it borrows all basic concepts. For each NMEA2000 physical hardware device attached to the CAN bus corresponds one ECU (Electronic Control Unit).
In this ECU one or more CA (Controller Application) is running. Each CA has its own address in the protocol and performs the actual processing of the received PDU.

Depending on the way the message_server is connected to the CAN bus, we have 2 possible architectures (see diagram).
When the system is connected to the bus via an adapter (Shipmodul Miniplex, Digital Yacht iKonvert, Yacht Digital YDEN-02), that device is the ECU and supports one or more CA functions (the Miniplex has 6 CA, while the others have 1).
While when the system is directly connected to the bus via its own CAN interface card, it is itself the ECU with several possible CA running.

The adapters have a specific protocol pseudo NMEA0183 or ad-hoc to communicate with the computer. They provide various level of transparency between the CAN level protocols and their interface. All have also a NMEA2000 to NMEA0183 translation function, but this is out of scope here.

NMEA2000 standard includes a specific transport layer in addition to the J1939/21 (usage is not clear from our knowledge of the standard). That transport layer named 'Fast Packet' allow to have an NMEA2000 PDA data (payload) of 223 bytes.
Some adapter process that transport layer but some others don't. To summarize what is done by what module in the various cases, see the table below.

| Case         | Module                 | Fast <br/>Packet | J1939/21 | Network <br/> Management | Device <br/> Management | Group <br/> Functions |

Network Management: All what is linked with device addressing and discovery on the CAN bus. Includes NMEA PGN 126996 and 126998
Device Management: Detection and knowledge of other devices on the network or own device
Group Function: There are 7 functions controlled by PGN 126208. Only the very minimum is implemented both as request or respondent

#### Service PGN

Several PGN are in the standard not to carry data for the monitoring and control of the vessel but only to manage the bus and communications over it.
There are called Service/ISO PGN ss some of them are common with J1939 / ISO11783.
By default, the lower layer of the message_server is intercepting these PGN and redirect them towards the corresponding application as stated in the table above.
They are not sent towards navigation control systems.

#### Data PGN

That is all other PGN beyond the one cited in the Service PGN. The list is changing frequently as new PGN are needed and tested.
All common PGN for Small yacht are already integrated this a list of 34 PGN in the current version (1.8).
The condition to integrate a new PGN is to have a device that generates it and the full definition. That can be challenging for proprietary PGN.


### Code generation

The code generator is taking the same XML definition file that is described in the section [XML definition file](https://github.com/Sterwen-Technology/navigation_server/blob/main/doc/NMEA2000.md#nmea2000-xml-definition-file)
The **code_generator** is to be used to add new PGN is the valid set or after any modification/correction in the XML file. A version of the files aligned with the XML file is part of the delivered package.

#### Running the code generator

The code generation script is located in the top directory of the distribution. To use it make sure that the virtual environment is active or use ```poetry run``` as an alternative.

A convenience script is provided (develop/gen_code) to perform a full code generation from the XML definition file:
- generation of Protobuf files for NMEA2000
- Generation of Python code supporting the Protobuf
- Generation of the Python code for NMEA2000

It is recommended to use this script to ensure the consistency of the generated code and its correct localization in the development tree.

Code generator detailed usage
    `python gen_code.py --help
        usage: gen_code.py [-h] [-d PYTHON_DIR] [-po PROTOBUF_DIR] [-pb] [-py] [-cv] [-ro] [-pgn PGN] [-c {iso,data,all}] [-o OUTPUT]

        code_generator.py

        optional arguments:
        -h, --help            show this help message and exit
        -d PYTHON_DIR, --python_dir PYTHON_DIR
                        Python output directory
        -po PROTOBUF_DIR, --protobuf_dir PROTOBUF_DIR
                        Protobuf output directory
        -pb, --protobuf       generate protobuf definitions
        -py, --python         generate Python code
        -cv, --protobuf_conv  generate Python <-> Protobuf conversion
        -ro, --read_only      generate all classes read only
        -pgn PGN, --pgn PGN   generate a specific PGN only
        -c {iso,data,all}, --category {iso,data,all}
                        generate a specific category (iso/data/all)
        -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        output file name without extension

The result can be located everywhere but for a direct integration in the existing framework, the following directory shall be used
 - Protobuf output directory: {BASE_DIR}/src/protobuf (default)
 - Python output directory: {BASE_DIR}/src/generated (default)

The minimum set of code that can be generated is a Python module that is decoding the PDU.

The full code generation must be performed in 3 steps:

- Step 1: generate the Protobuf definition
- Step 2: compile the Protobuf into Python
- Step 3: generate the Python classes

#### Generated code

#### Protobuf generation

The principle is to generate one message type per PGN with one Protobuf field per PGN field.
Example for the PGN 127489:

    `message Pgn127489ClassPb {  // Engine Parameters, Dynamic
	    uint32 engine_instance = 1;
	    float oil_pressure = 2;
	    float oil_temperature = 3;
	    float temperature = 4;
	    float alternator_voltage = 5;
	    float fuel_rate = 6;
	    float total_engine_hours = 7;
    }`

To build a Protobuf message including the whole PDU (header + data), the PGN specific shall be combined with the *nmea2000_decoded_pb* through the *payload* field.
The field name is given by the 'key' attribute of the Field definition in XML.

#### Python generation

The Python code generated is compatible with Python version 3.7.

All classes have a common super class: *NMEA2000DecodedMsg* . That class holds the header section of the PDU and all generic methods to create and convert objects.

All data classes are generated in a single file: *nmea2000_classes_gen.py* (by default). At the end of the file a dictionary (*nmea2k_generated_classes*) is giving the PGN class using the PGN number as key.
Classes can be derived to build additional specific behavior.
Main rules used for the generation:
 - instance attributes are generated from the XML *key* attribute with a leading underscore
 - All accessors (properties and setter) are generated with the XML *key* attribute as name
 - RepeatedFieldSet are generated as a nested class in the PGN class
 - NMEA2000 PDU to Python: *decode_payload*
 - Python to NMEA2000 PDU: *encode_payload* (if the PGN is not declared as read-only)
 - Protobuf to Python: *from_protobuf*
 - Python to Protobuf: *as_protobuf* (returns a Protobuf message object) or *set_protobuf* (copy the data in the Protobuf object)
 - Encoding of NMEA2000 PDU is limited to 223 bytes (Fast Packet limit)

#### Use of the generated code

The generated code is used in the following modules (object class in the configuration file):

 - **N2KTracePublisher** : data
 - **GrpcPublisher** : data
 - **GrpcInputApplication** : data
 - **Console** : ISO
 - **NMEA2000Application**: ISO
